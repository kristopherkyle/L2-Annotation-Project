## Introduction to Dependency Relations
Dependency relations capture functional grammatical relationships between words in an utterance. Each linguistic item in an utterance has one (and only one) syntactic head, but may have multiple (or no) dependents. For example, in the sentence `The hungry person ate the pizza`, the word `person` has one syntactic head `ate`. `person` is connected to `head` via a nominal subject `nsubj` relationship. `person` also has two syntactic dependents: `hungry` (via an adjective modifier relationship `amod`) and `The` (via a determiner relationship `det`).

## UD Annotation Scheme
Here, each dependency relation is described and examples of each are also given.

## Clarifications and special cases

### Copular `be`
In most sentences, the main verb of the first independent clause in a sentence is the "Root" of the sentence. In the example `The hungry person ate the pizza`, the syntactic head of `ate` is the "root" of the sentence (which isn't represented aside from the `root` tag.)

In constructions with copular be (e.g., `She is a professor.`), however, the `root` is the predicate (in this case, the nominal complement `professor`). The word `professor` has three dependents `She` via an `nsubj` relationship, `is` via a `cop` relationship, and `a` via a `det` relationship.

In copular constructions with clausal predicates, however, as in `The important thing is to keep calm`, the "normal" conventions are used (`is` is the `root`)
